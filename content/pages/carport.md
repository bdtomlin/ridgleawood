  title: Damaged Carport
---

The carport that services 4 units on the South end of the property has many
leaks and is dripping rust directly on the vehicles parked there.

This has been an ongoing issue with several failed attempts to patch the
carport. This solution will remove the tar and gravel from the roof and replace
it with a more modern roofing membrane.
