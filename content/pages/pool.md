The pump on the pool died and the pool failed inspection because of many issues. There have also been major issues with drainage around the pool. If it hadn't been for Tom Cochran during the heavy rains we would have had at least 5 units around the pool flood.

The following video is after Tom had already pumped water out of the pool down to about the first step several times.
