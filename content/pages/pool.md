The pump on the pool died and the pool failed inspection because of many issues. There have also been major issues with drainage around the pool. If the board had not drained the pool to the first step twice during the heavy rains we would have had 5 units around the pool flood. Even with draining out all of this water the pool still overflowed and filled the pool area with water.

The following video is after water had been pumped out of the pool down to about the first step twice.

Since this was an emergency situation, the board had to act quick to fix the problem and prevent damage to our property and to the property of our members.

This work has been done, but the bill is forthcoming and there are not any funds left in the budget to cover this, so it must be taken care of with a special assessment.
